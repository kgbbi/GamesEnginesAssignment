# Proposal

For My Assignment I am hoping to make a wormhole visual effect.

The wormhole will have different colours and visual effects as it goes further on which i hope to be procedurally generated.
The goal is to have a really visually pleasing effect that I believe would have a cool sci-fi vibe.

# What The Project Does

It aims to provide a visual experince that is pleaseant and gives off the impression of being in a wormhole.
